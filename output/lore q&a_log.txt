He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan. This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.

Question: tell me the origin of titans
Answer: titans are a group of giant humanoid creatures that have been living in the world for centuries. They are known for their strength and power, and their appearance is often described as that of a giant, humanoid creature with a head that is larger than a human's. The titans are believed to have originated from a group of ancient civilizations that once ruled the world. They are said to have been created by a powerful force that destroyed their civilization, leaving behind only the titans. The titans are feared and respected by humans, who view them as a symbol of strength and power.

Pieck is soon overwhelmed by the Scouts and is nearly killed before Falco Grice intervenes.

He then forces its jaws closed to crack the crystal and swallow the blood and spinal fluid belonging to the War Hammer Titan. Realizing that Galliard is next to be eaten, Falco and Gabi Braun begin shouting for Reiner, who wakes up in time to transform and distract Eren..

Devising a plan to distract her, Mikasa and Armin split up to confront Annie, but Eren is crushed under the collapsing tunnel. The Scout Regiment engages in battle with the Female Titan while Jean and Armin attempt to convince Eren to fight. When Eren finally finds his resolve, he transforms into his Titan form and clashes with the Female Titan..

[Night Of The End]
The portion of the Scout Regiment still led by Hange Zoë shares an uneasy campfire with Theo Magath and the remaining Warriors. The two sides are suspicious of each other given their respective histories and Annie Leonhart's skepticism that Eren Jaeger's friends will be able to kill him in the event that diplomacy fails. Yelena tries to fan the flames of that division, but largely fails until she brings up the death of Marco Bodt. Reiner Braun takes responsibility for that, but overemphasizes his feelings of guilt to Jean Kirschtein, who does not want to hear how awful Reiner feels about it. He begins to beat down Reiner, only to hit Gabi Braun by accident when she tries to protect her cousin. Gabi understands that Jean has good reasons for hating the Warriors, but pleads with him to help save her family in Liberio.

After hearing her talk about carrying on Zeke Jaeger's will, Jean Kirschtein brings the two into another room where Zeke is regenerating from the mock battle he had with Levi Ackermann, revealing that Zeke was actually working with the Scouts. Everything had gone according to plan, barring a few miscalculations; specifically the two children. However, Hange Zoë is unhappy with Eren for forcing the Scouts to come to his aid, and when Sasha passes away from her wounds, Jean blames Eren's actions for her loss..

Prompt: tell me about mikasa and levi's relationship

Context:

She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru. After her mother and father were murdered by bandits, Mikasa was rescued by Eren. She lived with him and his parents for approximately one year before the Fall of Wall Maria. Though she desires only to live a peaceful life with Eren, Mikasa chose to follow him into the military—where she is considered the best soldier among the 104th Cadet Corps. She later joined the Scout Regiment to continue following and protecting Eren..

[Levi Ackerman]
He is often formally referred to as Captain Levi, is the squad captain of the Special Operations Squad within the Scout Regiment, and is said to be humanity's strongest soldier..

However, Floch arrives with a dying Erwin Smith and request that the injection be used on Erwin. After losing Reiner Braun to the Cart Titan, Hange Zoë and the rest of Levi Squad arrive to find Eren and Mikasa Ackermann struggling with Levi for the injection, either with words or by force. Hange eventually manages to talk down Mikasa and Levi has everyone clear out so he can use the injection on Erwin.

He gives the injection to Armin who eats Bertholdt and emerges from his Pure Titan as his friends gather around..

Before Falco's brother Colt can stop them, Gabi retracts the wire, carrying both her and Falco up. Once on board she manages to shoot Sasha Braus before she and Falco are overwhelmed by the Scouts. After hearing her talk about carrying on Zeke Jaeger's will, Jean Kirschtein brings the two into another room where Zeke is regenerating from the mock battle he had with Levi Ackermann, revealing that Zeke was actually working with the Scouts.

Context:
[Night Of The End]
The portion of the Scout Regiment still led by Hange Zoë shares an uneasy campfire with Theo Magath and the remaining Warriors. The two sides are suspicious of each other given their respective histories and Annie Leonhart's skepticism that Eren Jaeger's friends will be able to kill him in the event that diplomacy fails. Yelena tries to fan the flames of that division, but largely fails until she brings up the death of Marco Bodt. Reiner Braun takes responsibility for that, but overemphasizes his feelings of guilt to Jean Kirschtein, who does not want to hear how awful Reiner feels about it. He begins to beat down Reiner, only to hit Gabi Braun by accident when she tries to protect her cousin. Gabi understands that Jean has good reasons for hating the Warriors, but pleads with him to help save her family in Liberio. Though he needs time to cool off, Jean agrees and the combined group heads towards the port where they expect to find a flying boat they can use to chase after Eren..

[Jean Kirschtein]
is a graduate of the 104th Cadet Corps, among whom he ranked the 6th best. Jean hails from Wall Rose's Trost District, and joined the military with hopes of living a peaceful life within the walls as part of the Military Police Regiment, but would later find himself joining the Scout Regiment..

[Declaration Of War (Season 4 Episode 5)]
In the basement of a building behind the stage, Reiner Braun reunites with Eren Jaeger for the first time in four years. He is terrified that Eren has come back to exact revenge, but Eren is calm and explains that he is here for the same reason Reiner originally came to Paradis Island. He asks Reiner for the reason he attacked in the first place, and understanding his point of view, he concludes that the two of them are the same. Given their situations they did not have a choice, either then or now. On the stage itself, Willy Tybur puts on a theatrical production of Eldian history as it is known to the rest of the world, only to reveal that the true end of the Great Titan War was brought about by King Karl Fritz himself, who worked with the Tybur family to manufacture the story of Helos. The King isolated himself and his people on Paradis Island and made a vow to renounce war that would be imposed on his successors, which would have kept the world safe from Titans, except that the Founding Titan has now changed hands to Eren, who is not bound by the same restrictions as those of the royal bloodline. Willy asks the world to unite with him as he declares war on Paradis..

[Zeke Yeager]
He was the former War Chief of Marley's Warriors, assigned to take the Founding Titan from the Eldians of Paradis Island. He was the current holder of the Beast Titan, and was considered the strongest warrior by Reiner Braun, contrasting Levi Ackermann's title of "humanity's strongest soldier." He manipulated and deceived both sides of the war between Eldia and Marley in order to achieve his own agenda of causing the extinction of his own people, which he viewed as "salvation." He was the son of Grisha Jaeger and Dina Fritz, older half-brother of Eren Jaeger through his father and a member of the Fritz royal family through his mother..
