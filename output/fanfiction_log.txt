[Midnight Sun (Season 3 Episode 18)]
Zeke tells Eren Jaeger that someday he will come back to rescue him. Eren then realizes that Zeke strongly resembles his father, Grisha. Levi Ackermann arrives to pursue Zeke with Eren's remaining weapons, when Eren suddenly realizes that Armin Arlelt is breathing. Eren asks Levi for the Titan injection so they can save Armin by having him eat the incapacitated Bertholdt Hoover. However, Floch arrives with a dying Erwin Smith and request that the injection be used on Erwin. After losing Reiner Braun to the Cart Titan, Hange Zoë and the rest of Levi Squad arrive to find Eren and Mikasa Ackermann struggling with Levi for the injection, either with words or by force. Hange eventually manages to talk down Mikasa and Levi has everyone clear out so he can use the injection on Erwin. However, when Erwin begins muttering a childhood memory, Levi decides it would be kinder to let him pass on. He gives the injection to Armin who eats Bertholdt and emerges from his Pure Titan as his friends gather around..

[Hero (Season 3 Episode 17)]
Zeke finishes off the remainder of the Scout Regiment recruits and pities them for wasting their lives. However, he is startled by Levi Ackermann, whose arrival was hidden by the Scouts' diversionary charge. Levi soundly defeats Zeke's Beast Titan, but before he can use a Titan injection to feed Zeke to a surviving Scout, the Cart Titan attacks Levi and then runs away with Zeke. Zeke sends his remaining Titans to finish off Levi. Meanwhile, Armin Arlelt splits his squad into two teams. Most of the squad leaves to hold off the Armored Titan and succeeds, thanks to the timely reappearance of Hange Zoë. Armin wakes up Eren Jaeger who is comatose in his Titan, and relays a plan that will allow them to defeat Bertholdt Hoover's Colossal Titan. Eren falls off the Wall and pretends to be unconscious while Armin distracts Bertholdt and goads him into using up all his energy to burn him alive. When Armin finally collapses, Bertholdt moves on to deal with Eren, but discovers Eren has secretly used his hardening powers to plug the remaining hole in the Wall. Eren ambushes Bertholdt from behind with ODM gear, and cuts him out of his Titan's nape, ending the battle..

[Eren Yeager]
He was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger, and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan, and the War Hammer Titan. Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan. This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.

[Zeke Yeager]
He was the former War Chief of Marley's Warriors, assigned to take the Founding Titan from the Eldians of Paradis Island. He was the current holder of the Beast Titan, and was considered the strongest warrior by Reiner Braun, contrasting Levi Ackermann's title of "humanity's strongest soldier." He manipulated and deceived both sides of the war between Eldia and Marley in order to achieve his own agenda of causing the extinction of his own people, which he viewed as "salvation." He was the son of Grisha Jaeger and Dina Fritz, older half-brother of Eren Jaeger through his father and a member of the Fritz royal family through his mother..

[Reiner Braun]
He is is the Eldian Vice Chief of the Warriors and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan from the Marleyan perspective. He is the illegitimate son of an Eldian mother and a Marleyan father who grew up in Liberio's internment zone. Eventually, he was selected as a child to become one of Marley's Warriors. From a young age, he inherited the power of the Armored Titan. In the year 845, he infiltrated Paradis Island alongside Bertholdt Hoover, Annie Leonhart, and Marcel Galliard as part of an operation to reclaim the Founding Titan. He joined the Scout Regiment after graduating 2nd in the 104th Cadet Corps..
