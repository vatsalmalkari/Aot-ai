[Old Story]
Historia recounts the circumstances of how she grew up on a farm as an unwanted child with a distant mother. She saw her father, Rod Reiss, for the first time when he came to see her after Wall Maria fell, but men in black coats intervened before he could take her away. Rod had them spare Historia under the condition that she live a quiet life far away under the name "Christa Lenz." In the present day, Rod apologizes for that and informs Historia that she has royal blood and is the only person who can save humanity. Meanwhile, Erwin meets Pyxis and discusses the overthrow of the government. When Hange arrives, they inform Erwin about Historia's royal lineage, and he tells Pyxis his plan to expose the puppet government and install Historia as the new queen. As dawn breaks, Erwin is called outside by the First Interior Squad to account for the murder of Dimo Reeves. He names Hange as his successor before he leaves and shortly thereafter, he and the Scout Regiment are placed under arrest..

[Mikasa Ackerman]
She is one of the two deuteragonists of the series. She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru. After her mother and father were murdered by bandits, Mikasa was rescued by Eren. She lived with him and his parents for approximately one year before the Fall of Wall Maria. Though she desires only to live a peaceful life with Eren, Mikasa chose to follow him into the military—where she is considered the best soldier among the 104th Cadet Corps. She later joined the Scout Regiment to continue following and protecting Eren..

[That Day]
Grisha Jaeger accepts a beating from Kruger for himself and on behalf of his sister for going outside the Liberio Internment Zone without permission. Gross supposedly escorts her home, but her body turns up in the river. Grisha's rage is fueled when he sees how meekly his father accepts the falsehood given to him by the Marley Public Security officer. As an adult, Grisha joins the Restorationists, where he meets his future wife. Dina Fritz. Together they have a son, Zeke, who they plan to make a Warrior in order to infiltrate Marley's mission to recover the Founding Titan. However, they are betrayed by Zeke and are sent to Paradis Island where they will be turned into Pure Titans. Though Dina is transformed, Grisha is saved at the last moment by Kruger, who reveals himself to be the Owl, the secretive leader of the Restorationists. Kruger tells Grisha to watch as he uses a knife to cut himself and transform into a Titan..

[Night Of The End]
The portion of the Scout Regiment still led by Hange Zoë shares an uneasy campfire with Theo Magath and the remaining Warriors. The two sides are suspicious of each other given their respective histories and Annie Leonhart's skepticism that Eren Jaeger's friends will be able to kill him in the event that diplomacy fails. Yelena tries to fan the flames of that division, but largely fails until she brings up the death of Marco Bodt. Reiner Braun takes responsibility for that, but overemphasizes his feelings of guilt to Jean Kirschtein, who does not want to hear how awful Reiner feels about it. He begins to beat down Reiner, only to hit Gabi Braun by accident when she tries to protect her cousin. Gabi understands that Jean has good reasons for hating the Warriors, but pleads with him to help save her family in Liberio. Though he needs time to cool off, Jean agrees and the combined group heads towards the port where they expect to find a flying boat they can use to chase after Eren..

However, Floch arrives with a dying Erwin Smith and request that the injection be used on Erwin.

[Assassins Bullet]
Tired after many battles in Liberio, Eren Jaeger beats back a weary Reiner Braun before retreating with Mikasa Ackermann to the Scout Regiment's airship. As the Scouts retreat, Gabi Braun chases after them with Falco Grice trying to stop her. She manages to kill Lobov and figures out how to use his omni-directional mobility gear to reel herself up to the airship. Before Falco's brother Colt can stop them, Gabi retracts the wire, carrying both her and Falco up. Once on board she manages to shoot Sasha Braus before she and Falco are overwhelmed by the Scouts. After hearing her talk about carrying on Zeke Jaeger's will, Jean Kirschtein brings the two into another room where Zeke is regenerating from the mock battle he had with Levi Ackermann, revealing that Zeke was actually working with the Scouts.

Eren falls off the Wall and pretends to be unconscious while Armin distracts Bertholdt and goads him into using up all his energy to burn him alive.

[Charge (Season 2 Episode 11)]
After hearing Ymir's motives, Historia agrees to stay by her side. The pursuing soldiers close in on the Armored Titan and corner Bertholdt, who refuses to give up Eren. Erwin leads a hellish charge against the Warriors in which he is injured, though Eren is rescued. Reiner refuses to let him escape and begins throwing Titans into the retreating formation. When Eren and Mikasa are dismounted in the chaos, they come across the Titan that ate Eren's mother five years ago..

[Midnight Sun (Season 3 Episode 18)]
Zeke tells Eren Jaeger that someday he will come back to rescue him. Eren then realizes that Zeke strongly resembles his father, Grisha. Levi Ackermann arrives to pursue Zeke with Eren's remaining weapons, when Eren suddenly realizes that Armin Arlelt is breathing. Eren asks Levi for the Titan injection so they can save Armin by having him eat the incapacitated Bertholdt Hoover. However, Floch arrives with a dying Erwin Smith and request that the injection be used on Erwin. After losing Reiner Braun to the Cart Titan, Hange Zoë and the rest of Levi Squad arrive to find Eren and Mikasa Ackermann struggling with Levi for the injection, either with words or by force. Hange eventually manages to talk down Mikasa and Levi has everyone clear out so he can use the injection on Erwin. However, when Erwin begins muttering a childhood memory, Levi decides it would be kinder to let him pass on. He gives the injection to Armin who eats Bertholdt and emerges from his Pure Titan as his friends gather around..

[Memories Of The future]
Zeke and Eren Jaeger travel through their father Grisha's memories as Zeke attempts to show Eren that Grisha only cared about him as a tool. However, he instead sees Grisha giving Eren freedom that Zeke never had as a child. Eren's determination and willingness to fight for his freedom are things he has always had on his own. When Grisha reacts to their presence in his memories, Zeke is surprised that Grisha has not forgotten about him. The day Wall Maria falls, they see Grisha confront Frieda Reiss in the underground chapel. Due to the vow to renounce war, she refuses to save the people of Wall Maria and insists the Eldians atone for their ancestors' crimes by accepting the world's hatred of them. Grisha reveals that he was led here by future memories he received through the Attack Titan. He plans to kill her to obtain the Founding Titan and end the royal bloodline, but falters because he does not want to murder children. Eren intervenes, and using the fact Grisha can hear him through his future memories, convinces Grisha to go ahead with the attack. Following the massacre, Grisha apologizes to Zeke, saying he was a terrible father, and asks him to stop Eren..

[Assassins Bullet]
Tired after many battles in Liberio, Eren Jaeger beats back a weary Reiner Braun before retreating with Mikasa Ackermann to the Scout Regiment's airship. As the Scouts retreat, Gabi Braun chases after them with Falco Grice trying to stop her. She manages to kill Lobov and figures out how to use his omni-directional mobility gear to reel herself up to the airship. Before Falco's brother Colt can stop them, Gabi retracts the wire, carrying both her and Falco up. Once on board she manages to shoot Sasha Braus before she and Falco are overwhelmed by the Scouts. After hearing her talk about carrying on Zeke Jaeger's will, Jean Kirschtein brings the two into another room where Zeke is regenerating from the mock battle he had with Levi Ackermann, revealing that Zeke was actually working with the Scouts. Everything had gone according to plan, barring a few miscalculations; specifically the two children.

[Erwin Smith]
He was the 13th commander of the Scout Regiment. Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected, Erwin was an able commander. While he cared deeply for his men, he did not hesitate to sacrifice them for the good and prosperity of mankind, and his men have proven more than willing to stake their lives at his order. Erwin developed the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation. Due to uncertainty about his future, he later named Hange Zoë as his successor..
