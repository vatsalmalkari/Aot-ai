Title: Old Story
Summary: Historia recounts the circumstances of how she grew up on a farm as an unwanted child with a distant mother. She saw her father, Rod Reiss, for the first time when he came to see her after Wall Maria fell, but men in black coats intervened before he could take her away. Rod had them spare Historia under the condition that she live a quiet life far away under the name "Christa Lenz." In the present day, Rod apologizes for that and informs Historia that she has royal blood and is the only person who can save humanity. Meanwhile, Erwin meets Pyxis and discusses the overthrow of the government. When Hange arrives, they inform Erwin about Historia's royal lineage, and he tells Pyxis his plan to expose the puppet government and install Historia as the new queen. As dawn breaks, Erwin is called outside by the First Interior Squad to account for the murder of Dimo Reeves. He names Hange as his successor before he leaves and shortly thereafter, he and the Scout Regiment are placed under arrest.
