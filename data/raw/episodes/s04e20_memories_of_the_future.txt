Title: Memories Of The future
Summary: Zeke and Eren Jaeger travel through their father Grisha's memories as Zeke attempts to show Eren that Grisha only cared about him as a tool. However, he instead sees Grisha giving Eren freedom that Zeke never had as a child. Eren's determination and willingness to fight for his freedom are things he has always had on his own. When Grisha reacts to their presence in his memories, Zeke is surprised that Grisha has not forgotten about him. The day Wall Maria falls, they see Grisha confront Frieda Reiss in the underground chapel. Due to the vow to renounce war, she refuses to save the people of Wall Maria and insists the Eldians atone for their ancestors' crimes by accepting the world's hatred of them. Grisha reveals that he was led here by future memories he received through the Attack Titan. He plans to kill her to obtain the Founding Titan and end the royal bloodline, but falters because he does not want to murder children. Eren intervenes, and using the fact Grisha can hear him through his future memories, convinces Grisha to go ahead with the attack. Following the massacre, Grisha apologizes to Zeke, saying he was a terrible father, and asks him to stop Eren.
