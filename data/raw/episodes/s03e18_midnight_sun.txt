Summary: Zeke tells Eren Jaeger that someday he will come back to rescue him. Eren then realizes that Zeke strongly resembles his father, Grisha. Levi Ackermann arrives to pursue Zeke with Eren's remaining weapons, when Eren suddenly realizes that Armin Arlelt is breathing. Eren asks Levi for the Titan injection so they can save Armin by having him eat the incapacitated Bertholdt Hoover. However, Floch arrives with a dying Erwin Smith and request that the injection be used on Erwin. After losing Reiner Braun to the Cart Titan, Hange ZoÃ« and the rest of Levi Squad arrive to find Eren and Mikasa Ackermann struggling with Levi for the injection, either with words or by force. Hange eventually manages to talk down Mikasa and Levi has everyone clear out so he can use the injection on Erwin.
