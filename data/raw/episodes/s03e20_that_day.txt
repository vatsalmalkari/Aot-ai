Title: That Day
Summary: Grisha Jaeger accepts a beating from Kruger for himself and on behalf of his sister for going outside the Liberio Internment Zone without permission. Gross supposedly escorts her home, but her body turns up in the river. Grisha's rage is fueled when he sees how meekly his father accepts the falsehood given to him by the Marley Public Security officer. As an adult, Grisha joins the Restorationists, where he meets his future wife. Dina Fritz. Together they have a son, Zeke, who they plan to make a Warrior in order to infiltrate Marley's mission to recover the Founding Titan. However, they are betrayed by Zeke and are sent to Paradis Island where they will be turned into Pure Titans. Though Dina is transformed, Grisha is saved at the last moment by Kruger, who reveals himself to be the Owl, the secretive leader of the Restorationists. Kruger tells Grisha to watch as he uses a knife to cut himself and transform into a Titan.
