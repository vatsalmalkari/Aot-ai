Title: Assassins Bullet
Summary: Tired after many battles in Liberio, Eren Jaeger beats back a weary Reiner Braun before retreating with Mikasa Ackermann to the Scout Regiment's airship. As the Scouts retreat, Gabi Braun chases after them with Falco Grice trying to stop her. She manages to kill Lobov and figures out how to use his omni-directional mobility gear to reel herself up to the airship. Before Falco's brother Colt can stop them, Gabi retracts the wire, carrying both her and Falco up. Once on board she manages to shoot Sasha Braus before she and Falco are overwhelmed by the Scouts. After hearing her talk about carrying on Zeke Jaeger's will, Jean Kirschtein brings the two into another room where Zeke is regenerating from the mock battle he had with Levi Ackermann, revealing that Zeke was actually working with the Scouts. Everything had gone according to plan, barring a few miscalculations; specifically the two children. However, Hange ZoÃ« is unhappy with Eren for forcing the Scouts to come to his aid, and when Sasha passes away from her wounds, Jean blames Eren's actions for her loss.
