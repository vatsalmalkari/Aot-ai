Title: Sin (Season 3 Episode 6)
Summary: Eren Jaeger learns the history of how he obtained his Titan and how five years ago his father, Grisha Jaeger, slaughtered most of the Reiss family in order to obtain their power, which was held by Frieda Reiss, the elder half-sister of Historia Reiss. Meanwhile, the military learns that certain bloodlines are immune to the "Scream" that can alter humanity's memories and that if they do not rescue Eren they may soon forget their coup d'Ã©tat ever happened. Squad Levi arrives at the rural chapel above the underground one where Eren is being held. They prepare to attack while the Anti-Personnel Control Squad waits for them below.
