Title: Assault (Season 4 Episode 7)
Summary: The Scout Regiment and the Warriors face off as the Beast Titan joins the battle. Though Pieck is initially optimistic about Marley's chances, the arrival of Armin Arlelt's Colossal Titan changes the flow of combat when it wipes out all the military reinforcements in Liberio's port. Porco Galliard impulsively splits away from the group to attack Eren Jaeger, giving Levi Ackermann the opportunity to topple the Beast Titan. Pieck is soon overwhelmed by the Scouts and is nearly killed before Falco Grice intervenes. Galliard manages to rip off one of the Attack Titan's arms and swipes at its head, but Eren blocks it with Lara Tybur's crystal, which is unexpectedly scratched by the Jaw Titan's claws. When the Scouts' airship arrives to extract their soldiers, Galliard attempts to switch targets only to be caught by Mikasa Ackermann, who severs his Titan's legs. Eren removes the Jaw Titan's remaining limbs before shoving Lara's crystal between its jaws. He then forces its jaws closed to crack the crystal and swallow the blood and spinal fluid belonging to the War Hammer Titan. Realizing that Galliard is next to be eaten, Falco and Gabi Braun begin shouting for Reiner, who wakes up in time to transform and distract Eren.
