Title: I'm Home (Season 2, Episode 2)
Summary: The Scout Regiment set out for Ehrmich to assist in the crisis, bringing Pastor Nick with them to try to convince him to talk. On the way, Armin theorizes about the Wall Titans. Earlier, whilst riding to alert citizens, Sasha remembers her past with her father after the fall of Wall Maria. At a village, Sasha saves a girl from a small Titan. She tells the child to run, and blinds the pursuing Titan to escape. She later reunites with her father, who had saved the child. Meanwhile, Conny arrives in his village, to see it in ruins. He rides to his house, but sees an immobile Titan laying atop it.
