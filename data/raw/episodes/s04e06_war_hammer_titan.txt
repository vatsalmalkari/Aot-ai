Title: War Hammer Titan (Season 4 Episode 6)
Summary: Before the Liberio festival, Willy Tybur and Theo Magath are aware that their enemies are likely to attack the festival, and make plans to take advantage of this. In the present, Eren Jaeger's Attack Titan eats Willy and begins to massacre the festival attendees. Lara Tybur transforms into the War Hammer Titan to engage him, while the rescued Pieck and Porco Galliard witness the appearance of the Scout Regiment. The War Hammer Titan defeats Eren and asks for his last words, but he is saved by Mikasa Ackermann, who disables the Titan in a surprise attack. Meanwhile, Commander Magath orders the Marleyan military to converge upon Liberio in order to trap the enemy. Enraged by the deaths of Udo and Zofia, Gabi Braun heads towards the battlefield. As Mikasa reengages the reanimated War Hammer Titan, Eren discovers Lara Tybur's crystal controlling her Titan via a cable. He transforms again and severs the cable, but is attacked by the Jaw Titan before he can eat it. Eren is saved by Levi Ackermann, and Galliard is quickly surrounded by more Scouts.
