Title: Perfect Game
Summary: The Scout Regiment battles on two fronts. Inside Shiganshina District, Jean Kirschtein takes over for Armin Arlelt in leading Levi Squad in an attempt to stop the Colossal Titan. However, Eren Jaeger's Titan is easily kicked away and Mikasa Ackermann is unable to land a hit, even using the new Thunder Spears. On the other side of the Wall, the Scouts are devastated by the Beast Titan's rock bombardment, leaving Erwin Smith, Levi Ackermann, and the new recruits as the only survivors. Realizing that they are likely to die, regardless of what happens, Erwin stakes everything on a final operation. He leads all the recruits on a decoy suicide charge towards the Beast Titan, so that Levi can approach undetected and kill it.
