Title: Zeke Yeager
Summary: He was the former War Chief of Marley's Warriors, assigned to take the Founding Titan from the Eldians of Paradis Island. He was the current holder of the Beast Titan, and was considered the strongest warrior by Reiner Braun, contrasting Levi Ackermann's title of "humanity's strongest soldier." He manipulated and deceived both sides of the war between Eldia and Marley in order to achieve his own agenda of causing the extinction of his own people, which he viewed as "salvation." He was the son of Grisha Jaeger and Dina Fritz, older half-brother of Eren Jaeger through his father and a member of the Fritz royal family through his mother.
