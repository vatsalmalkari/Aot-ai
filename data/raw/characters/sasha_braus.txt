Title: Sasha Braus
Summary: She was a member of the Scout Regiment and one of the few former members of the 104th Cadet Corps, of which she was ranked 9th out of the top 10. A compulsive food hoarder with an overly polite way of speech, Sasha originated from Dauper, a village in the southern territory of Wall Rose.
