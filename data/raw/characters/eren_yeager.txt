Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city.

This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth
