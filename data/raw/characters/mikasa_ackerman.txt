Title: Mikasa Ackerman
Summary: She is one of the two deuteragonists of the series. She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru. After her mother and father were murdered by bandits, Mikasa was rescued by Eren. She lived with him and his parents for approximately one year before the Fall of Wall Maria. Though she desires only to live a peaceful life with Eren, Mikasa chose to follow him into the militaryâ€”where she is considered the best soldier among the 104th Cadet Corps. She later joined the Scout Regiment to continue following and protecting Eren.
