Title: Historia Reiss
Summary: She is the current Queen of the Walls. She is a graduate of the 104th Cadet Corps and a former member of the Scout Regiment. She is also the illegitimate child of the nobleman Rod Reiss and the last remaining member of the Reiss royal family. During her cadet days, she went by the name of Christa Lenz to take on a new identity, after being coerced into renouncing her name and claim to the Reiss heritage. She eventually reclaimed her true name, becoming an important asset to the Regiment. After a successful coup d'etat, Historia ascends to the throne and becomes the new queen of the Walls, replacing the old puppet monarch.
